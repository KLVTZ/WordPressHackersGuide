Take Control of your Environment
================================
One of the most important things to consider, when starting a new wordpress
project, is separating your environment setup and isolating key wordpress
components. That is, taking control of your environment means isolating
wordpress core, keeping your content in a dedicated space, and allowing the
preference of different environments.

Let's take a look at our Wordpress Galaxy setup. The most important thing to
note is that our project lives inside our public folder. From within there, we
have our content folder, an index to get the ball rolling for our wordpress
folder, and a dedicated config file that points to our environment
configurations. 

Our configuration folder allows us to define environments and key wordpress
constants that are used throughout the project. 

Make sure that your server is pointing to the public folder on setup:

```bash
WordpressGalaxy
├── composer.json
├── composer.lock
├── config
│   ├── env
│   └── wordpress.php
├── public
│   ├── content
│   ├── index.php
│   ├── wp
│   └── wp-config.php
└── vendor
    ├── autoload.php
	    ├── composer
		└── johnpbloch
```
