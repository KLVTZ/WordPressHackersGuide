Custom Commands
===============
Custom commands within WP CLI offer us flexibility in running wordpress tasks
that would otherwise take us longer to do. In many ways, it is automating the
most difficult task available.

To start out, we will take advantage of our scaffolding tool built right in the
CLI. To begin, let's run `wp scafold plugin hikersquote`. This command will
scafold or generate a plugin that will extend the WP CLI class.

We will create a class that extends the `WP_CLI_Command` class. This class will
add new methods to our existing Hiker Command class. We will provide a function
for adding a new post. This action will take all the arguments provided from the
array argument and assign them to their very own variables. We then use these
properties to make an insert.

We then run the static function of success. This allows us to declare that the
post was created succesfully. We then add our command to WP CLI. Notice that we
also have comments, synopsis, in order to display the command's purpose on
runtime.

```php
<?php

/**
 * Prints a greeting. Defaults to --draft=false
 *
 * @synopsis --title=<string> --quote=<string> [--draft]
 */
class HikerCommand extends WP_CLI_Command
{
	public function add($args, $assoc_args)
	{
		extract($assoc_args);		
		wp_insert_post([
			'post_type' => 'quotes',
			'post_title' => $title,
			'post_content' => $quote,
			'post_status' => !empty($draft) ? 'draft' : 'publish',
		]);

		WP_CLI::success("{$title} was successfully created");
	}
}

WP_CLI::add_command("hiker", "HikerCommand");
```

We can now run our command to post a quote with a title, quote, and a flag for
draft: `wp hiker add --title="Hello" --quote="Command center" --draft`
