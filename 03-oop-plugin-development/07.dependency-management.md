Dependency Management
=====================
As our project grows larger, the more dependencies we accumulate. Because of our
solutions in the previous lesson, we can now intergrate dependency management by
defining where specific plugins should live. 

By defining our autoloader to be immediately loaded along our bootstrap file. We
can load specific classes that are dedicated to the functionality of wordpress
and the extension of default behavior. All this without having to think about
activating the plugin.


But what about custom plugins we write? These should live in our predefined area
of plugins. That is, the `content/plugins` folder. But what about our
name-spacing? We implement our very own custom namespace. The SPL will properly
load our request as it defaults back to the plugins directory to load any other
class that may be instantiated. This doesn't support third-party plugins, they
will load as default plugins do. But for our very own implementations, we can
take advantage of namespacing. 

In this short example, we are loading two objects. One is our Random Class
object and the other is another class that lives in another file. Notice the
the second class resolves itself thanks to SPL


```php
<?php

/**
 * Plugin Name: Some Cool Plugin
 * Author: KLVTZ
 */

namespace KLVTZ\SomeCoolPlugin;

trait CreatePosts {

	public  function create_content_type($options)
	{
		return "You just created a new content type, with traits, called " . $options["type"];
	}
}

class RandomClass {

	use \KLVTZ\SomeCoolPlugin\CreatePosts; 
	protected $content_type_message;

	public function __construct($options)
	{
		$this->content_type_message = $this->create_content_type($options);
	}


	public function print_message()
	{
		echo $this->content_type_message;
	}
}

add_ction('plugins_loaded', function ()
{
		$object = new RandomClass(["type" => "Location"]);
		$someObject = new \SomePlugin\SomeClass();
});
// add_action('init', [$object, "print_message"]);
```
